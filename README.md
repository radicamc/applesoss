## Code for the APPLESOSS Empirical Profile Construction Module

The empirical profile construction, aka the **APPLESOSS** (A Producer of ProfiLEs for SOSS) module builds 2D spatial profiles for the first, second, and third diffraction orders for a NIRISS/SOSS
GR700XD/CLEAR observation. The profiles are entirely data driven, only employing models where absolutely necessary and as such retain a high level of fidelity to the original observations.

These profiles are intended to be used as the specprofile reference file for the **ATOCA** 1D extration algorithm, or alternatively as a PSF weighting for optimal extractions.

The latest release of **APPLESOSS** can be downloaded from PyPI by doing:

    pip install applesoss

or the latest development version can be grabbed from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/radicamc/applesoss
    cd applesoss
    pip install .

The GitHub version also includes testing data and examples.
