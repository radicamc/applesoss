## Code for the APPLESOSS Empirical Profile Construction Module

The empirical profile construction, aka the **APPLESOSS** (A Producer of ProfiLEs for SOSS; Radica et al. 2022) module builds 2D spatial profiles for the first, second, and third diffraction orders for a NIRISS/SOSS
GR700XD/CLEAR observation. The profiles are entirely data driven, only employing models where absolutely necessary and as such retain a high level of fidelity to the original observations.

These profiles are intended to be used as the specprofile reference file for the **ATOCA** 1D extration algorithm, or alternatively as a PSF weighting for optimal extractions.
